# TODO: Web Components 😏

ToDo app that every frontend beginner writes on his second day of
learning, but built using Web Components.

## Running the app

You can't just open `index.html` in your browser (CORS).
The website must be accessed via the web server.

You can run web server with python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

and app will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`
